# Journey-->Telegram bot (pagepalbot)

It was not completed, but I was only able to complete it up to the use of /preview only. For the completion of code up to there, also ChatGPT helped a lot.Â 

First I asked ChatGPT how to create a Telegram bot; it told me to activate a virtual environment by using Python as the code language.<br>
Then I setup it and created a file for the Python code to be uploaded to the Telegram bot. For that, we need the bot's tokken code for that, so I approached the botFather to create a bot for this project named 'PagePalBot.'<br>

After that, I created the Google API key. With the help of ChatGPT, I obtained some code and replaced the token and key and tried so many times but was not able to get the bot to be working.<br>

At last I came to know I was not able to run the Python code, so I asked ChatGPT for help, and then finally I was able to make the Telegram bot run. Then I did not get any output or any response from Google Books API, so again I modified the code to take the Google Book API key and generate the output.<br>

So finally, I was able to make the Telegram bot give the output in CSV files. But the problem about the /reading_list was not troubleshooted by me.<br>

Sadly, I was not able to continue the telegram bot to its fullest.
But may try to do when understudying the concept of making a telegram more correctly.
