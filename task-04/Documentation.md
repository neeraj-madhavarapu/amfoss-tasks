# Telegram bot (pagepalbot)

It was not completed but I was only able to complete it upto the use of /preview only. for the completion of code upto there also chatgpt helped a lot . 

first i asked chatgpt how to create a telegram bot it told to activate a virtual environment by using python as the code language.
Then i setup it and created a file for the python code to be uploaded to the telegram bot for than we need the bot's tokken code for that , so , I approched the botFather to create a bot for this project named 'PagePalBot'
after that I created the Google API key , with the help of chatgpt I obtained some code and replaced the tokken & key and tried so many time but for not able to get the bot be working .
At last i came to know i did not able to run the python code  so asked chatgpt for help and then final i wass able to make the telegram bot to running .
then i did not get any output or any responce from google books API so again I modified the code to take the Google book API key and generate the output .
So finaly i was able to make the telegram bot to give the output in CSV files . But the problem about the /reading_list was not trouboshooted by me .
Sadly I was not able to continue the telegram bot to it's fullest .
But may try to do when understud the concept of making a telegram more correctly.
