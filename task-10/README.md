# Operation Pixel Merge

## jounery

This was also a intrusting task where i learned about the use of OpenCV to detect a dot in the given .png file and also detect the colour of that dot .<br>
After the detection of the dot's coordinates and the files in which complete white background is present .
I learned to draw lines on a Image by using PIllow. i also included in that code like when w is present then the coordinates have to be set to the null character and when the  d is present then the drawn image is displayed as out put.

I have mentioned the getten coordinates and colour code in [part1.py](https://github.com/neeraj-madhavarapu/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-10/code/part1.py) file and the secound part to draw the lines in [part2.py](https://github.com/neeraj-madhavarapu/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-10/code/part2.py)

The final code to know the sceret code is given in [final_code.py](https://github.com/neeraj-madhavarapu/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-10/code/final_code.py)

I realy loved this task as it was way more intresting then the previous tasks done upto know....<3
