# Journey-->Pirate's Dilemma(mp4 subtitles searcher)

I have done it in 4 parts. <br> 
First, I have done the CLI with the mentioned commands; this can be seen in the[partI.py](https://github.com/neeraj-madhavarapu/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-07/partI.py). 

The second part consists of the code to get the IMDB ID of a movie when the movie location is given, along with the running of the code.This is possible by the use of an IMDB API key, which I obtained from the omdbapi.com website. Hence, I was able to get the IMDB ID; this is present in [partII.py](https://github.com/neeraj-madhavarapu/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-07/partII.py).

The third part consists of the hash code + IMDb ID. From giving the file location, we will get the IMDB ID, movie hash, and movie size. This can be seen in [partIII.py](https://github.com/neeraj-madhavarapu/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-07/partIII.py) 

The fourth code consists of the code by which the subtitles can be searched by giving the movie IMDb ID [partIV.py](https://github.com/neeraj-madhavarapu/amfoss-tasks/blob/main/task-07/partIV.py)

This is also an interesting task, as it let me know more about the CLI,  how they work, and about API keys.
