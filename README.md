## About Me
Hey there, I am Neeraj Madhavarapu. I was very interested in building and designing stuff. I was quite conscious of my mental and physical health. I was interested in learning new stuff. I was not athletic but plays outdoor games. I was also interested in the electronics part. I am a great listener to music (slow pase, romantic, and pop). I was also into Vedio editing.

## Why should we choose you?

I am very interested in exploring and designing stuff. Not only coding, but from my early years I have been interested in building stuff. I am a fully committed one, with hard work along with soft skills as the bases. Also, I am strong in the electronics part, which makes me a good one to find out the soft as well as the hard stuff of a project. I will give my all to complete the work, and I hope you will enjoy joining and doing work with you guys!!

## How do you intend to contribute back to the club?

At present, my knowledge is somewhat limited, but I can guarantee you that with some guidance, I will definitely exceed my limits. With the knowledge I gained, I will contribute by solving problems and hope it will solve some creative problems as well. I will definitely ask advice and guide my co-pawns. Through my critical thinking, I will be able to contribute in many sectors.

## What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?

I was interested in exploring stuff, like when I first learned coding, I really fell for it. With my sir's advice, I was able to learn C and Python in some depth by doing problems on HackerRank. Second was learning physics, with which I fall in my +1 and +2. That was buiding stuff from my small ages. I was continuously making stuff and destroying it when I found new ideas. Also, I was unable to record my collection of stuff I made. I was very sad about that. Reading is also my interest, in which I love thrills and romance as my genre. These are some of my interests.
