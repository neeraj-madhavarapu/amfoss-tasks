# LINUX
So,the installation of linux .I have faced many deficulties (oh god!!), I thought of dual booting it along side window but at the first try my usb drive came off when it stuck a wall, in the secound chance as it installed parcially in the first attempt it got a msg saying this can't be installed . Thus I again uninstralled and reinstralled it, finally getting it worked!!!
