# Journey LINUX
At last I installed the ubuntu .I have faced many deficulties, I thought of dual booting it along side window but at the first try my usb drive came off when it stuck a wall, in the secound chance as it installed parcially in the first attempt it got a msg saying this can't be installed . Then again, I uninstralled and reinstralled it, finally getting it to work!!!
thought of as a easy one but made some wrong steps.Â
