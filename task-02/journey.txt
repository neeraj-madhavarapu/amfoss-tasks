journey...

the first part is very easy when i go through the tree diagram then i seen the parchment.txt in which i found the first code:

first code: aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRo

the secound part is very fustrating to me as i struggled a lot to find the light room finaly i came across the "git branch -r" command so finally was able to find the light realm and when into it .
there i seen the "KharnoktheBloodforged.py" which when run came a amazing animation which is superb and it told to use holy spell which i did not created yet.
so i used grep to search the herb files which have good and holy in there context.
herb names:
Moonbloom Lnnmaknnl
Mistveil  Lhrsudhk

the holy spell(with removing vowels):LnnmknnlLhrsdhk

So by using this holy spell we created i defeted the Kharnok and obtained the Celestial Veil Amulet's code "CSigVmaroAn" and the secound part of the code is found in the light book.

secound code :dWIuY29tL2FtYW5ze

Know i when to the Dark Real I and II and opened the chests by using the amulet's code.
The code in the chest1 is "GNhbGlidXIvVGVyb"
the code obtained by unlocking chest2 is "WluYWwtQ2hhb3MtR29kU3VpdGU=".

the final code obtained:aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2FtYW5zeGNhbGlidXIvVGVybWluYWwtQ2hhb3MtR29kU3VpdGU=" 

decoded -- "https://github.com/amansxcalibur/Terminal-Chaos-GodSuite" 

after that i open the godsuite in again i was stuck. this is the worst furstration of my life. At last i came to know the "git log" and "git show" thus ending the pandamic of mine.
so from there i found another code "aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2FuZ3JlemljaGF0dGVyYm94L1RvLXRoZS1zdGFycy1hbmQtcmVhbG1zLXVuc2Vlbg==" 

which decoded to "
https://github.com/angrezichatterbox/To-the-stars-and-realms-unseen"

so at last found the victory.py which concludes the task.

realy loved it <3.....
