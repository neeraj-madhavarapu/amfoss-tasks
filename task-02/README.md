# journey..-->Terminal Chaos

The first part is very easy. When I go through the tree diagram, I i seen the parchment.txt, in which i found the first code:

            # First code: aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRo

The second part is very frustrating to me as I struggled a lot to find the light room. Finally, I came across the "git branch -r" command, so I was finally able to find the light realm and get into it.
There, I saw the "KharnoktheBloodforged.py" which, when run, came with an amazing animation, which is superb, and it told me to use a holy spell, which I had not yet created.
So I used grep to search the herb files that have good and holy in their context.
herb names:
Moonbloom: Lnnmaknnl
Mistveil:  Lhrsudhk

            # The Holy spell(with removing vowels):LnnmknnlLhrsdhk

So by using this holy spell we created, I defeated the Kharnok and obtained the Celestial Veil Amulet's code, "CSigVmaroAn" and the second part of the code is found in the light book.

            # secound code :dWIuY29tL2FtYW5ze

I went to Dark Real I and II and opened the chests by using the amulet's code.
The code in chest 1 is:

            # code 3: "GNhbGlidXIvVGVyb"

The code obtained by unlocking chest2 is;

            # code 4: "WluYWwtQ2hhb3MtR29kU3VpdGU=".

the final code obtained:
            "aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2FtYW5zeGNhbGlidXIvVGVybWluYWwtQ2hhb3MtR29kU3VpdGU=" 

decoded --> "https://github.com/amansxcalibur/Terminal-Chaos-GodSuite" 

After that, I opened the godsuite in again and was stuck. This is the worst furstration of my life. At last, I came to know the "git log" and "git show" thus ending my pandamic.
So from there, I found another code;
            "aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2FuZ3JlemljaGF0dGVyYm94L1RvLXRoZS1zdGFycy1hbmQtcmVhbG1zLXVuc2Vlbg==" 

which was decoded to 
            "https://github.com/angrezichatterbox/To-the-stars-and-realms-unseen"

so at last found the victory.py which concludes the task!!

Really loved it <3......
