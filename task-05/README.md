# Journey-->Terminal Trolly

this is basicly a website in which we use the api to retreive the produts and there prices .
after that we will creat a website file in html and a css for for the styling of the code .
the js file is to preform the taskes when some thing is done on the website like when commands are given to the terminal the will be controlled by this file.
this task for me is a burden but was only able to do half of the part, the checkout part is not coming.
I was unable to mannage and understand the making of html codes along with css and js files.
but at last able to do a half of the website.
